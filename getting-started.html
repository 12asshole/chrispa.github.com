						<h3>Step 1 - Create Students</h3>
						<p>Once you have signed up you find yourself on Trillo's homepage.  There isn't a lot here yet, but that's because you don't have any students set up!  We designed Trillo with the student as the center, so creating some is your first step.</p>
						<p>You may have a lot of students - if that is the case we recommend you start by setting up <i>tomorrow's</i> students.  Then you can use Trillo tomorrow to manage your daily schedule, then add the next day's students, and repeat.  To start click on the 'My Students' link in the navigation bar, then on 'Add Student'</p>

					<div class="grid-one-third">
						<h3>Step 2 - Enter Student Details</h3>
						<p>The initial new student page has only the basic information needed for each student. </p>
						<p>1- First, Last name, their grade, the city or town they live in</p>
						<p>2- A longer field to enter any specific information about the child (peanut allergy, etc.)</p>
						<p>3- A field where you can overide the default billing (which you will set up later.  $50/lesson is just the system default.)</p>
						<p>4- A default avatar is set for the student, and you can set up their lesson start and end time.</p>

					<div class="grid-8">
						<h3>Are they family members?</h3>
						<p>Underneath the lesson time dropdowns is a checkbox that says 'Add to Existing Account'  If this student has a sibling who has already been added to the system, then check this box and choose the family name from the dropdown that appears.  That links the students for Family Billing. </p>

					<div class="grid-one-third">
						<h3>Step 3 - Enter contacts for student</h3>
						<p>Adding the student will take you to their details page.  The next step is to add one or more contacts for the student.  Click the 'Add Contact' button.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="grid-6">
						<h3>Contact Details: Lesson Notes & Invoices</h3>
						<p>You can add as many contacts per student as you need.  Each contact can have different addresses and phone numbers to handle different family situations.  You can also check off whether the contact should receive the lesson notes and the invoices.</p>

						<h3>Step 4 - Use Trillo for your daily schedule</h3>
						<p>This is an example of how your homescreen will look when you have students entered and scheduled for lessons that day.</p>
						<p>Clicking on a student will bring up the lesson reconciliation page, where you can record lesson notes.</p>

					<div class="grid-6">
						<h3>Step 5 - Record Each Lesson</h3>
						<p>The is the lesson details page. From here you can:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Write a private note about the lesson for your records</li>
						
							<li>Write a note to the parents about the lesson.  Even if you see the parents at pickup this is a great habit to get into - parents love it!  No need to write an essay, just a short note is all you need.</li>
							<li>Click on 'View Student' to see any details about the student (previous lesson notes, overdue balance, parent names, etc.)</li>
						</ol><br />
						<p>Finally you mark the lesson as Complete or Missed.  Any private notes and emails are saved and sent at this time.</p>
