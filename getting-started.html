        <h2>Getting Started with Trillo</h2>
        <p>This guide has been written to help new customers get started using Trillo.  It will walk you through the basic steps we reccomend you take to get started, with the specific goal of testing out how Trillo works to get a sense of if it will solve your current registration and class management problems.</p>
        <p>As always we are only an email or phone call away.  Please contact us at help@trilloclass.com or call 802-318-4714 if you run into problems.  Thank you for trying Trillo!</p>
        
        <h4>Rule #1: Just click - you ain't gonna break it!</h4>
        <p>Trillo comes with a little bit of 'dummy data' to help you see how things work.  There is a class already set up, with two students enrolled.  There is also one Registration form for you to review.  So our #1 piece of advice is to start clicking & editing things.  You'll quickly get a feel for how it all works together.</p>

        <h2>1) Setting Up Your Organization</h2>
        <p>The first screen you see after signing up for Trillo is the Organization Settings page.  To return to this page in the future just click the 'Settings' link in the upper right.  Let's set a few things up:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Email Address:</b> This is email where your customers can contact you.  It will be the 'Reply-To' email for any emails Trillo sends on your behalf (like registration confirmation emails.)</li>
          <li><b>Waivers:</b> These are two waivers that will show up on EVERY registration form you create.  You will also have the ability to create Registration Form Specific waivers when you create the forms.  For now let's just put something in both of these fields.  Then when you view the registration form you create later, you can see where the language is inserted.</li>
          <li><b>Collecting Payment:</b> We allow you to connect with a service called Stripe in order to collect credit cards.  For now let's NOT connect the Stripe account (even if you have one.)  It's easier to see how everything works first and then come back and add payment collection.</li>
          <li><b>Users:</b> These are users who can access your Trillo account.  Users who are not admins can do everything except access this Settings page.</li>
          <li><b>Sessions:</b> Trillo requires you to organize classes by what we call Sessions.  You can have as many as you would like, and you can create different registration forms for different sessions.  Create a few here now.</li>
          <li><b>Locations:</b> If you have multiple locations you can enter those here.  Locations is used simply as a filter.  So for example you can filter/email/export all the classes at a specific location.</li>
          <li><b>Instructors:</b>  Just like Locations, Instructors is used to filter & organize classes.  Each class can only have one instructor, so if you have classes where there are two you'll need to create a separate instructor.  For example: Julie Smith/Wendy Davis</li>
        </ol>  
        
        <h4>That's it for Settings!  Click 'Update Settings' at the bottom of the page.</h4>
        
        <hr>
        
        <a name="setting-up-classes"></a>
        <h2>2) Setting Up Classes</h2>
        <p>Next, click on the Classes tab on the top navigation bar.  You'll see there is an example class already created called 'Drawing With Chalk'.  Next click the button on the right side 'Add Class'.</p>
        <p>Note that a Class in Trillo is a distinct instance of that class.  So if in the Fall session you have three different 'Tumbling For Tots' (one on Monday, one Wed, one Fri) then you should create three different classes in Trillo.  (We'll show you how to duplicate classes later!) </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Name:</b> The class name!</li>
          <li><b>Active?:</b> If a class is marked Active then it WILL show up on Registration forms.  If it is NOT active it will not.  A handy way to add future classes without letting people register for them yet, or pull a class from the Registration form.</li>
          <li><b>Description:</b> This field currently does NOT show up in any public facing page.  Use if you want, but not required.</li>
          <li><b>Days:</b> Choose the days this class will be offered.</li>
          <li><b>Start/End Dates:</b> When the class starts and ends.  Note that once the class is over it will automatically show up in Past Classes.  You can click on 'View Past Classes' on the Classes home screen.</li>
          <li><b>Time:</b> When the class is held.  Note that this field can be any text - Trillo doesn't do any time calculations.  So you can enter things like 'Call To Schedule'</li>
          <li><b>Cost:</b> Total cost of the class.  You can enter zero if the class is free.</li>
          <li><b>Kid/Adult/Teen:</b> Who is the class for?  This is used for filtering when creating Registration forms.  You can select multiple categories.</li>
          <li><b>Max Enrollment:</b> Trillo tracks the number of enrolled students.  When a class reaches this limit new registrations aren't allowed.  No more wildly oversubscribed classes!!  Here is what your customer will see: The class is still seen on the Registration form, but the button to select it disappears.  A note next to the class will say 'Class Full - Please email for waitlist.'  At this time Trillo doesn't automatically handle waitlist (but it's something in the pipeline.)</li>
          <li><b>Session/Instructor/Location:</b> Specific details to help organize classes.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>That's it! Click 'Create Course' to create the class.</h4>
        
        <hr>
        
         <a name="setting-up-regform"></a>
        <h2>3) Setting Up A Registration Form</h2>
        <p>Next we'll go through the options available to set up a new registration form that your customers can use to register for your classes.  You can have multiple Registration forms in Trillo and each will have a unique URL that you can point to on your website.</p>
        <p>Why would I want multiple registration forms?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have some classes where you want to capture a LOT of emergency contact information, but others where you don't want to capture any.</li>
          <li>You might have a separate form for Events or Birthday parties where no emergency contact info is collected.</li>
          <li>You want to collect just a registration fee for some classes, but the full class cost for others.</li>
          <li>You have specific instructions or waivers JUST for a subset of your classes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Here are the form fields and how they affect the Registration form:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Name:</b> The name of the form!  This does show up at the top of the public form.</li>
          <li><b>What classes?:</b> Forms are filtered based on Sessions and on Class Type (below)</li>
          <li><b>Class Type?:</b> Are there only certain types of classes we should include?  Check all if you want all classes to be included.</li>
          <li><b>What kind of Emergency Contact Info Should we collect?:</b> Comprehensive is the most, Basic is more streamlined, and none skips that section altogether.  Note that for Adults we ONLY collect Basic information, even if Comprehensive is checked off.  In other words - Comprehensive vs Basic only applies to children. </li>
          <li><b>Print out?:</b> Do you want customers to have an option at the end of the form to print it out and mail it in with a check?</li>
          <li><b>Specific Instructions:</b> These Instructions show up at the top of the form on every page of the form.</li>
          <li><b>Specific Legal Waiver:</b> This waiver shows up on Page 2 AND Page 3.  The best advice regarding the waiver info is to try something, then view the form to see where it is located.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b>That's it!</b>  Clicking Create will take you back to all the Registration forms.  Clicking the 'View' button to the right of the form will open the form in another tab in your browser.  Clicking 'Copy' will copy the URL of the form to your computer clipboard.  This is the URL you should point your 'Register Now' button to on your website.</p> 

        <h4>How to test: Register A Few 'Dummy' Students</h4>
        <p>The best way to test a form is to fill it out yourself.  Fill it out with some dummy data, then change some of the form settings, and go back and fill it out again.  This also shows you how students are created in Trillo and how they show up in classes.</p>
        <p><b>Tip: Use @example.com for dummy emails</b>  The email address is a required field, and we suggest you register at least one student with your own email address so you can see what the email confirmation looks like.  For the rest of any dummy registrations just use an @example.com email address.  That won't get sent to anything.</p> 
        
        <hr>
        
        <a name="howto"></a>
        <div class="how-do-i">
         <h2>4) How Do I......? Everything you need to know.</h2>
        <h4>Can I edit the confirmation email?</h4>
        <p>No, it currently cannot be edited.  We have purposely made it generic and very basic - all it does is confirm their registration in the class(es) they signed up for.  We suggest you send a separate email if there is specific class information they need to know right away.</p>
        
        <h4>How do I turn off registration once a class is full?</h4>
        <p>You don't need to!  Just set the 'Max Enrollment Size' in the class setup.  Once that # has been reached Trillo will still show the class in the registration form, but the checkbox to select it will be gone.  Customers will see a message to email you for a waitlist.  </p>
        <p>Note - You are still able to add students to classes that are full from within Trillo.  So when someone calls and 'just has to have Jimmy' in a certain class, you can still add them!  </p>
        
        <h4>What if I don't want to limit the # of registrations? </h4>
        <p>Just set the Max Enrollment Size in the class setup to a large number that you don't think you would ever reach.</p>
        
        <h4>What do I need to do on my website to start using Trillo?</h4>
        <p>You need to have a registration link point to the Trillo registration form you created.  Click on the Registration Forms link in the navigation bar.  To the right of each registration form is a 'Public' column which has a View and Copy button.  Click the copy button and point the link on your website to that URL.</p>
        <p>For example - if you click the View button a new tab will open up with your registration form.  The web address in the browser will look something like this:</p>
         
        <p  class="text-info"> <small>https://app.trilloclass.com/organizations/115848188/registration_forms/529874751/registrations/new</small></p>
        <p>That is where you point your registration link.</p>
            
        <h4>How do I add a student to a class manually   </h4>
        <p> First use the search field in the Students tab to find the student in the system (or set them up.)  Then click the Add Class button Under the 'General Info' field in the middle of the screen).  Choose the class and click 'Enroll'  (use the search fields at the top to narrow the list of classes if you have a lot.)  A confirmation email is NOT sent so you'll want to send one manually. </p>
        
        <h4>Can I sign up someone for a class and change the cost?   </h4>
        <p>YES!  Follow the instructions above to manually enroll a student in a class.  You'll notice a field to 'Override Cost'.  Just put the new cost of the class in that field.  This is for situations where a sibling gets a discount, someone wins a raffle prize and gets the class for free, etc.   </p>
        
        <h4>Can I email a Student/Parent from within Trillo?  </h4>
        <p>You can email a group of students (or their primary contacts if they are children) but you cannot email an individual.  For that you need to use your regular email.   </p>
        
        <h4>So how do I email a group of Students?</h4>
        <p>There are two places you can do this.  The first is from the Class Details page.  Click on the Class in the class list.  The click the 'Email Class' button which is below the name of the class at the top of the page.  This is great for the '1 Week To Go' email where you tell everyone what to bring, etc.</p>
        <p>The second is from the Classes page.  Use the Filters to show the classes you want, then you need to choose them by checking them off.  Then click the Email Classes button.  This is great if you need to quickly contact all the students that take a class on a specific day (Snow Day - Classes Canceled!) or instructor (Suzy is sick, etc.) or everyone (Recital next Tuesday..)</p>
        
        <p>Note - the 'Reply To' field in this email is the address you set up in the Organization Settings.</p>
        
        <h4>I've set up a lot of classes - how can I filter them?   </h4>
        <p>On the Classes tab use the dropdowns to choose what you would like to filter, then click the Filter button to the right.  Click Reset to go back to the standard view.  You can filter by combinations as well - for example just the classes at Studio C, on Wednesdays, where Susan is the instructor.</p>
        
        <h4>How do I duplicate classes for the next session?</h4>
        <p>First - create the new Session in the Organization settings.  Classes are duplicated from one Session to another.  Then, choose the classes you want to duplicate using the checkboxes to the left of the classes (filter by session, etc first.)  Click Duplicate Classes.  You will prompted for the new Session, then click 'Duplicate' (on the right side.)</p>
        <p>You will see the class duplicated in the list with a NOT ACTIVE flag set.  Notice that the enrollment for the new class is empty.  The only thing you need to do is edit the class to make sure the dates/times/cost are correct for the new class.</p>
        
        <h4>Help - I set up a class but can't find it in the classes list.   </h4>
        <p>Usually that is because the dates of the class are in the past.  At the top of the Classes tab click the 'View Past Classes' link.  If you find your class in there (and it shouldn't be there!) just click on the class name, then the Edit button to edit it.  Change the end date to be in the future and click Update Course at the bottom.  It should show up in the Current Classes list now.</p>
        
        <h4>How do I remove a student from a class?</h4>
        <p>Edit the class and scroll to the bottom.  There is a section called 'Edit Enrollment'  Just click 'Remove Student' to remove the student from the class.</p>
        
        <h4>Can I duplicate a Registration Form? </h4>
        <p>Right now you cannot.  But you can easily change the session that a form covers by editing it.  So if registration for the Fall classes is over, just edit the form to choose the new session.  That way you don't have to change the registration links on your website and the new classes show up on the form.</p>
