         <h2 class="text-success">Designed for YOUR business</h2>
         <p>We have worked closely with art studios, dance studios, and other class based businesses to design Trillo around solving their specific problems.  For example, need to contact all the parents/students in a specific range of classes?  (Snow days, sick instructor, flood/building damage, etc.)  Trillo makes it easy.</p>
         <p>Trillo has been built to have enough features to let it fit with your current business, but not so many that you need to spend any time figuring it out!  Contact us today to see how Trillo could help your business.</p>

         <h2 class="text-success">Flexible Ways To Charge</h2>
         <p>Trillo allows you to charge however you'd like, and keep track of who still owes you money.  You can accept registrations with no charge, charge the full amount of the class, or charge a deposit (fixed fee or a %.)  Students are listed as Paid or Balance/Partial Balance Due so the instructor knows who to expect checks from. </p>

          <p>If you are looking to accept credit cards, Trillo integrates with <a href="https://stripe.com" target="new">Stripe</a>, a great new option without all the traditional monthly fees and long-term contracts.  Accepting credit cards can significantly improve your cash flow, and help reduce your cancellation rate.</p>
          <p>Payments can be a tricky area - feel free to contact us to discuss what might work best for you.  Stripe is available today in the US and Canada - more International options are coming soon!</p>
