  	  <p class="date">23 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>Many times you need to communicate with all the members of a class, for example to send out an announcement. Trillo makes this VERY easy, and keeps you from having to deal with email groups (which is especially a hassle when the people enrolled in the class change.)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you needed to cancel a specific class. With Trillo you can send an email to all the students (or their Primary contacts) with one click from the &#8216;Class Details&#8217; page.</p>
<img src='/img/blog/email-class.png' />
<p>Simply view the class details and click the &#8216;Email Class&#8217; button. Type your message and hit send. An email is sent to every student (or their primary contact if they are a child.) Your email address is set as the &#8216;Reply-to&#8217; address, so your customers can reply to the message if they need to. Clients love this feature in order to reach out to all the students in a class 1 week beforehand to remind them about the class and what they should bring.</p>

<p>Need to contact more than one class? No problem! Let&#8217;s say you need to cancel ALL your classes for a specific day. Visit the Classes view and filter by the day of the week. Select all the classes and click the &#8216;Email Classes&#8217; button. The functionality is exactly the same as the image above.</p>

<p>Hope this helps make your class communications a little easier to manage!</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">16 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>Today we have launched a free email course called &#8216;Streamlining the &#8216;Tech&#8217; side of your business so you can get back to doing what you love.&#8217; Yeah - it&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful, but it describes the point of the course perfectly! Technology was supposed to make our lives easier, but too often we see clients where the technology is either getting in the way, or causing MORE work. Technology can often be an intimidating thing for some people, so we are hoping this course will take a little bit of the mystery out of things as well as give guidance on what is important vs what is not.</p>

<p>The course consists of 6 emails delivered over 3 weeks. You can unsubscribe at any time, and signing up for the course doesn&#8217;t also sign you up for more marketing from us. (We hate Spam too!) Here is what we cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your website &amp; email: Getting The Big Two Right</li>

<li>Is your website user friendly?</li>

<li>Simple steps to start automating the &#8216;not-so-much-fun&#8217; stuff</li>

<li>Have your thought about your business data lately?</li>

<li>Turn up your email marketing</li>

<li>Are you in the tech support business?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to sign up just visit <a href='/'>http://trilloclass.com</a> and scroll down the page. You&#8217;ll need to confirm your email address once you have signed up. Please let us know what you think - you can reply to any of the 6 emails from us.</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">09 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>A common problem for class providers who have created their own registration systems through some combination of online forms, paypal, etc. is that there is no way to automatically turn off registrations when a class is full. This creates all sorts of work for you (the provider) and also create ill-will among your customers.</p>

<p>Lets say you open registration for a one day camp to take place when the local schools are off for a teacher workshop. Smart right? Absolutely, until you email your mailing list to let them know about the class. Suddenly you have 25 registrations for a 15 student class! So now&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to figure out who is &#8216;in&#8217; and who is &#8216;out&#8217;.</li>

<li>Then contact 10 parents and tell them that even though they thought they were all set for that day, actually they aren&#8217;t. You can really screw this up by waiting for a while - then all the other camps will have filled up and your potential customers will REALLY be annoyed.</li>

<li>Did you process registration payments through Paypal? Well now you need to go into Paypal and issue 10 different refunds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suddenly that little one day class is turning into a lot of work.</p>

<p>This is where using a dedicated student/class management solution like Trillo helps. We let you set a &#8216;Max Enrollment&#8217; for every class. Once it&#8217;s full customers can no longer register for it. (The class DOES show up on the list of classes, but the checkbox to choose it is gone. We also show a message saying the class is full and they can email for a waitlist.) Now you can email your mailing list encouraging people to sign up as soon as they can because classes fill up&#8230;.but not worry about being over-subscribed!</p>

<p>One of the bigger points that gets missed here is the disappointment your customers have with you when they thought they had registered, but in fact they were too late. As a parent I can tell you that when I click &#8216;Register&#8217; I assume it is taken care of! Do you have any nightmare registration stories from being over-subscribed? Let us know in the comments!</p></section>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/start-button.jpg' />
<p>We&#8217;ve recently created an initial version of a &#8216;Getting Started&#8217; document for new clients. We walk through the basics, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up your organization</li>

<li>Setting up classes</li>

<li>Setting up your first registration form</li>

<li>Common &#8216;How Do I&#8230;&#8217; type of questions</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course we are ALWAYS available via email for any support needs, and are happy to help you set up your account. But hopefully this will give new clients a bit of a head start. The link to the page is at the bottom right of our homepage, you can also find the page here: <a href='/getting-started.html'>Getting Started With Trillo</a></p></section>

<p>This is the last post explaining the functionality behind the three buttons to the left. The final button is the &#8216;Email Class&#8217; button, and it does what you would naturally expect - it opens a window that lets you email the whole class right from within Trillo.</p>

<p>This keeps you from having to maintain separate email lists (which quickly become out of date once you add/remove someone from the class.) And it lets your instructors communicate with the class without accessing your base email account.</p></section>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/savetime1.png' />
<p>The first step in being prepared in the case of an emergency is to have currently emergency contact information for each child. The second step is making sure that information is easily available in every situation. Trillo helps with BOTH steps.</p>

<p>We recommend you always print a hard copy of the emergency contact information for each class. Relying on a spreadsheet is not good enough. What if the computer crashes? Your Internet access goes down? What if the instructor took the class to the park or some other off-site location?</p>

<p>Just like our attendance sheets, printing the emergency contact information is one click and you have a nicely formatted list for all the members of that class.</p></section>

<p>Trillo makes it easy to print your class attendance sheets. Simply click the &#8216;Print Attendance Sheet&#8217; button when viewing the specific class. A separate tab will open in your browser with a nicely formatted list that you can print. We include a notes field for any last minute items, and we highlight students who have not yet paid so the instructor knows to expect payment.</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">06 Nov 2012</p>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/stripe-logo.jpg' />
<p>Online payment is the third part of Trillo. In todays Amazon.com dominated world your customers expect and want to be able to pay for classes online. There is no question that accepting credit cards can be expensive (the fees!) and time consuming to deal with the administrative work required. Trillo has built in support for a new service that we believe is the best option BY FAR for anyone looking to accept credit cards - it&#8217;s called Stripe.</p>

<p>Stripe.com is a service that allows you to quickly start accepting credit cards. Here are the things we like most about Stripe:</p>

<p>1) NO monthly fees! Many businesses we have spoken to are paying $20-30/month just for the privilege to accept credit cards. Until recently you had no choice - you needed either a merchant account or a Paypal Business level account. Stripe charges no monthly fees beyond their transaction fee (more on that below) - no monthly fee, card storage fees, etc. You can save a significant amount of monthly costs just by moving to Stripe.</p>

<p>2) Very competitive rates. Stripe charges 2.9%+.30 cents per transaction, including Amex. If you look at the overall rate you are paying (not the teaser rate!) for ALL cards, plus your monthly fees, you&#8217;ll find Stripe to be VERY competitive. Plus the no monthly fee means you can try it out with no long term contracts or risk.</p>

<p>3) Extremely simple signup. The administrative hassles of signing up for a merchant/gateway account are legendary. Rarely do you talk to anyone who has anything good to say about the experience! Stripe removes all of that pain with a much simpler process.</p>

<p>4) A great experience for your customers. This might be the most important - a simple, clean form for your customers to pay you with. Forwarding your customers to Paypal works, but it&#8217;s not an ideal workflow. And we have clients who know of customers who refuse to pay with Paypal due to a bad experience.</p>

<p>Singing up for Stripe can be done within Trillo - that links the two applications together. (Details in a future blog post.) If you have held off from accepting credit cards in the past, it&#8217;s time to reconsider!</p></section>

<p>The second area of focus for Trillo is helping a business with the ongoing management of their student contacts. When a customer of yours fills out a Trillo powered registration form, they are set up as a contact in your account. No more form submissions ending up in your inbox as more data entry! For many of the businesses we have spoken to, this data entry of new registrations can be a significant waste of time. Linking your registration forms to student management software has many other time saving benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The printing of attendance sheets and emergency contact information becomes a simple one-click process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>No more oversold classes! Trillo lets you limit the size of a class. Stop spending time emailing parents to tell them their child ISN&#8217;T in your class, and then having to submit refunds through Paypal.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Quickly see who is in what class, which classes are full, and how old everyone in a class is. More 5 year olds registered than you are used to? Now you know in a glance!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Get the data out of your head and available to your staff - now instead of asking you every question they can look up the student history in Trillo.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One more huge advantage to ongoing student management - customer analytics. Do you know your lifetime revenue per family? How many kids take repeat classes? How many families have multiple siblings in your program? Trillo helps you start running your business like, well&#8230;, a business. Your student/parent contact database is one of the most important parts of your business, and an integrated system quickly pays for itself with time savings.</p>

<p>Up next: Online payment done right!</p></section>
