  	  <p class="date">08 Mar 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>As a web services company, we get exposed to a lot of other web services in my day-to-day life. One common theme among some of what I consider the &#8216;Best&#8217; services are that they let their personality shine through. It&#8217;s easy to be &#8216;goofy&#8217; - what&#8217;s hard is to be genuine.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;re occasionally going to highlight a few here on our blog because we think they are great examples of how every small business can show their customers that there are real people behind the business.</p>

<h1 id='mailchimp'>MailChimp</h1>
<a href='http://mailchimp.com' target='new'>http://mailchimp.com</a>
<p>MailChimp helps millions of people design, send, and track their email newsletters. We use them for ours, and highly recommend them. MailChimp&#8217;s personality shines throughout their site. In fact it shines so brightly some customers must have complained! There is a &#8216;Party Pooper&#8217; mode in the account settings for people who are, well, party poopers.</p>
<img src='/img/blog/party-pooper-mailchimp.png' style='margin:20px 0 20px 0' />
<p>But even though the &#8216;MailChimp Personality&#8217; is everywhere, it doesn&#8217;t detract from the experience. They use that personality to guide you the somewhat complicated experience of creating and sending email newsletters.</p></section>

  	  <h1><a href="/2013/02/22/HowTo---Accept-Donations-For-Scholarships.html">HowTo - Accept Donations For Scholarships</a></h1>
  	  <p class="date">22 Feb 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>One of the items on our feature list is the ability to ask for a donation to a scholarship fund when a client is checking out. While that is a few months away, there is a quick &#8216;n easy way that you can have up and running right now. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>

<p>1) Create a new session and call it &#8216;Scholarships&#8217;</p>

<p>2) Create a class that is called something like &#8216;Scholarship Fund Donation - $10&#8217;</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the class dates be from Jan 1 - Dec 31st</li>

<li>Set the enrollment at a large #&#8230;say 100</li>

<li>Put the class in the Scholarships session</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Now for every Registration form you create, have the &#8216;Scholarships&#8217; session classes show on it as well as the other classes. Now there is a &#8216;Class&#8217; that people can sign up for in addition to the other classes that will add a $10 charge (or whatever you set it to) to their total.</p>

<p>One of the advantages here is that when a client donates to the fund they become part of the Sholarship class. So now you have a record of all the people who have donated. That makes it easy to send them a nice letter at the end of the year detailing how their generosity helped!</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">17 Feb 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>&#8216;Explainer&#8217; videos have been very popular lately, but we didn&#8217;t think we had the expertise or the budget to put one together. Then we found <a href='http://www.powtoon.com/' target='new'>Powtoon</a>, a super easy way to create explainer videos. A couple of weeks later and, voila!, we&#8217;ve now got one. It&#8217;s lots of fun putting one of these together, and the constraints around what graphics you can show really make you think through your message. We hope this helps explain Trillo to people who just didn&#8217;t quite get it before.</p>

<p>Looking for a little more detail? Don&#8217;t worry - soon we will have a longer screencast of Trillo in action, and we are going to add shorter &#8216;How do I&#8230;&#8217; clips to help new users get up and running. Now that we have the video bug it&#8217;s kind of hard to stop!</p>

  	  <p class="date">30 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/unpaid-status-report.png' />
<p>We just added a new page to Trillo that should be a big help to any clients who are processing registrations through Trillo but are NOT collecting credit card payments. (Side note - why would someone do this? Either they don&#8217;t want to pay the credit card processing fees, OR they are an international business where our processor doesn&#8217;t yet reach.) It&#8217;s important for these businesses to easily see who has not paid them yet!</p>

<p>In the Students tab there is a new button that says &#8216;Show Unpaid&#8217;. It will then show you a list of all enrollments that have a status of unpaid. One thing to note - each class/enrollment is a different line. We chose not to consolidate things as we felt it&#8217;s easier to get a good sense of the overall picture of your account.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p></section>

<p>Wistia is a video hosting provider. They drink their own kool-aid, and produce fantastic videos to announce just about everything they do. Below is their 2012 year end &#8216;Rap&#8217; wrap-up. Love the personality that shines through - it just makes you want to explore using their product. Do you think these guys dread going to work on Monday?

  	  <p class="date">23 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>Many times you need to communicate with all the members of a class, for example to send out an announcement. Trillo makes this VERY easy, and keeps you from having to deal with email groups (which is especially a hassle when the people enrolled in the class change.)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you needed to cancel a specific class. With Trillo you can send an email to all the students (or their Primary contacts) with one click from the &#8216;Class Details&#8217; page.</p>
<img src='/img/blog/email-class.png' />
<p>Simply view the class details and click the &#8216;Email Class&#8217; button. Type your message and hit send. An email is sent to every student (or their primary contact if they are a child.) Your email address is set as the &#8216;Reply-to&#8217; address, so your customers can reply to the message if they need to. Clients love this feature in order to reach out to all the students in a class 1 week beforehand to remind them about the class and what they should bring.</p>

<p>Need to contact more than one class? No problem! Let&#8217;s say you need to cancel ALL your classes for a specific day. Visit the Classes view and filter by the day of the week. Select all the classes and click the &#8216;Email Classes&#8217; button. The functionality is exactly the same as the image above.</p>

<p>Hope this helps make your class communications a little easier to manage!</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">16 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>Today we have launched a free email course called &#8216;Streamlining the &#8216;Tech&#8217; side of your business so you can get back to doing what you love.&#8217; Yeah - it&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful, but it describes the point of the course perfectly! Technology was supposed to make our lives easier, but too often we see clients where the technology is either getting in the way, or causing MORE work. Technology can often be an intimidating thing for some people, so we are hoping this course will take a little bit of the mystery out of things as well as give guidance on what is important vs what is not.</p>

<p>The course consists of 6 emails delivered over 3 weeks. You can unsubscribe at any time, and signing up for the course doesn&#8217;t also sign you up for more marketing from us. (We hate Spam too!) Here is what we cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your website &amp; email: Getting The Big Two Right</li>

<li>Is your website user friendly?</li>

<li>Simple steps to start automating the &#8216;not-so-much-fun&#8217; stuff</li>

<li>Have your thought about your business data lately?</li>

<li>Turn up your email marketing</li>

<li>Are you in the tech support business?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to sign up just visit <a href='/'>http://trilloclass.com</a> and scroll down the page. You&#8217;ll need to confirm your email address once you have signed up. Please let us know what you think - you can reply to any of the 6 emails from us.</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">09 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>A common problem for class providers who have created their own registration systems through some combination of online forms, paypal, etc. is that there is no way to automatically turn off registrations when a class is full. This creates all sorts of work for you (the provider) and also create ill-will among your customers.</p>

<p>Lets say you open registration for a one day camp to take place when the local schools are off for a teacher workshop. Smart right? Absolutely, until you email your mailing list to let them know about the class. Suddenly you have 25 registrations for a 15 student class! So now&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to figure out who is &#8216;in&#8217; and who is &#8216;out&#8217;.</li>

<li>Then contact 10 parents and tell them that even though they thought they were all set for that day, actually they aren&#8217;t. You can really screw this up by waiting for a while - then all the other camps will have filled up and your potential customers will REALLY be annoyed.</li>

<li>Did you process registration payments through Paypal? Well now you need to go into Paypal and issue 10 different refunds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suddenly that little one day class is turning into a lot of work.</p>

<p>This is where using a dedicated student/class management solution like Trillo helps. We let you set a &#8216;Max Enrollment&#8217; for every class. Once it&#8217;s full customers can no longer register for it. (The class DOES show up on the list of classes, but the checkbox to choose it is gone. We also show a message saying the class is full and they can email for a waitlist.) Now you can email your mailing list encouraging people to sign up as soon as they can because classes fill up&#8230;.but not worry about being over-subscribed!</p>

<p>One of the bigger points that gets missed here is the disappointment your customers have with you when they thought they had registered, but in fact they were too late. As a parent I can tell you that when I click &#8216;Register&#8217; I assume it is taken care of! Do you have any nightmare registration stories from being over-subscribed? Let us know in the comments!</p></section>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/start-button.jpg' />
<p>We&#8217;ve recently created an initial version of a &#8216;Getting Started&#8217; document for new clients. We walk through the basics, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up your organization</li>

<li>Setting up classes</li>

<li>Setting up your first registration form</li>

<li>Common &#8216;How Do I&#8230;&#8217; type of questions</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course we are ALWAYS available via email for any support needs, and are happy to help you set up your account. But hopefully this will give new clients a bit of a head start. The link to the page is at the bottom right of our homepage, you can also find the page here: <a href='/getting-started.html'>Getting Started With Trillo</a></p></section>
