<p>The second area of focus for Trillo is helping a business with the ongoing management of their student contacts. When a customer of yours fills out a Trillo powered registration form, they are set up as a contact in your account. No more form submissions ending up in your inbox as more data entry! For many of the businesses we have spoken to, this data entry of new registrations can be a significant waste of time. Linking your registration forms to student management software has many other time saving benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The printing of attendance sheets and emergency contact information becomes a simple one-click process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>No more oversold classes! Trillo lets you limit the size of a class. Stop spending time emailing parents to tell them their child ISN&#8217;T in your class, and then having to submit refunds through Paypal.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Quickly see who is in what class, which classes are full, and how old everyone in a class is. More 5 year olds registered than you are used to? Now you know in a glance!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Get the data out of your head and available to your staff - now instead of asking you every question they can look up the student history in Trillo.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One more huge advantage to ongoing student management - customer analytics. Do you know your lifetime revenue per family? How many kids take repeat classes? How many families have multiple siblings in your program? Trillo helps you start running your business like, well&#8230;, a business. Your student/parent contact database is one of the most important parts of your business, and an integrated system quickly pays for itself with time savings.</p>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/online-form1.png' />
<p>Trillo has 3 main parts that we want to talk about. The first is providing our customers simple online registration forms that their customers can use to register for classes. Every time we talk to a small business who offers classes, they say the same thing: their customers are asking for online registration.</p>

<p>Why is online registration important? In today&#8217;s fast paced world a business needs to allow a customer to act on their interests immediately. This is especially important if you do any email marketing. All that work to get a prospect interested in your classes, they are ready to sign up and then&#8230;.you make them jump through a whole bunch of hoops. Download the form, print the form, fill it out by hand, find the checkbook and write a check, find an envelope and stamp, address the envelope, and then mail it. Trust me - if you have kids there is no way you get through these steps without being interrupted!</p>

<p>An online form skips all of these steps. A prospect sees your email, clicks on a link to your website, clicks a button and fills out the form online. Your prospect had a need, you put a solution in front of them (a class to take), and the customer was able to act on it immediately while the thought of taking action was still &#8216;top of mind.&#8217; The fewer steps there are in your signup process the more likely they will be completed.</p>

<p>What about the forms themselves? Are there differences between forms that will cause some to work better than others? Absolutely! Customers are used to forms that are clear, look professional, and are easy to understand. Online forms allow your customers to do your data entry for you, while making their own lives easier. A true win-win!</p>

<p>Next up: How customers aren&#8217;t really doing your data entry for you if all that happens is that you get an email with the registration data.</p></section>

<p>It’s not uncommon for new businesses to end up serving a completely different customer than they originally intended to. The photo site Flickr started out as a feature of an online game. Groupon started as an online activist platform! Trillo started as a student management tool for independent music teachers. But in talking with that market an even bigger problem (and opportunity!) emerged – helping businesses who offer classes for children a simple tool to enable online registration, online payment, and ongoing student management.</p>

<p>The most common solution to the problem is to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Have customers print out, fill out, and mail in a registration form with a check</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use a combination of online forms, Paypal, and spreadsheets</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither of these are great solutions for the business, or for their clients. Systems end up being a mish-mash of different services where customer data is repeated (and often out of date) and data entry is endless. Current solutions are expensive and/or out of date.</p>

<p>Providers who offer classes for children have even more issues. They need to collect emergency contact information, make sure waivers are signed, and track things like peanut allergies. Parent interactions are brief – so it pays to get things right the first time.</p>

<p>We have some fantastic beta clients (more on them later), and a very clear problem to solve. Trillo will be live right around Thanksgiving. If you currently offer classes and are struggling with online registration we’d love to talk to you about how Trillo can help.</p></section>

<p>When we started designing Trillo, one of the first things we needed to decide on was what the software would be ‘centered’ on. That is, what is the most core and basic part of the software that connects everything else? What is the thing that, if it was missing, would remove the whole point of using the software?</p>

<p>The answer was pretty simple – <strong>it’s the student.</strong></p>

<p>We started calling the idea <em>‘student centered design’</em>, and we’ve used that phrase to guide us when making decisions about what features to include, and more importantly, how to include them without making the software bloated, difficult to navigate, hard to update, and no fun to use. Your music teaching practice revolves around your students, so we think it makes sense for your software to do the same. There was a great blog post last Friday from Fred Wilson, who is a prominent Venture Capitalist in NYC, and who has a wonderful blog. He talked about what the ‘atomic unit’ of your web service is….and that if you don’t know (or have gotten away from it) you have a problem. It’s a great way to think about software design and coming up with a list of key principles to guide you.</p></section>
