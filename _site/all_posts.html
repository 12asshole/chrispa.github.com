  	  <p class="date">30 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/unpaid-status-report.png' />
<p>We just added a new page to Trillo that should be a big help to any clients who are processing registrations through Trillo but are NOT collecting credit card payments. (Side note - why would someone do this? Either they don&#8217;t want to pay the credit card processing fees, OR they are an international business where our processor doesn&#8217;t yet reach.) It&#8217;s important for these businesses to easily see who has not paid them yet!</p>

<p>In the Students tab there is a new button that says &#8216;Show Unpaid&#8217;. It will then show you a list of all enrollments that have a status of unpaid. One thing to note - each class/enrollment is a different line. We chose not to consolidate things as we felt it&#8217;s easier to get a good sense of the overall picture of your account.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p></section>

  	<section class="entry"><p>As a web software provider, I get exposed to a lot of other web services in my day-to-day life. Some of them are services we use here at Trillo, and others are just ones I explore to see what I can learn. One common theme among some of what I consider the &#8216;Best&#8217; services are that they let their personality shine through. It&#8217;s easy to be &#8216;goofy&#8217; - what&#8217;s hard is to be genuine. (It&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t be hard, but for some reason it is.)</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m occasionally going to highlight a few here on our blog because I think they are great examples of how every small business can show their customers that there are real people behind the business. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>First up is&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

<h1 id='wistia'>Wistia</h1>

<p>Wistia is a video hosting provider. They drink their own kool-aid, and produce fantastic videos to announce just about everything they do. Below is their 2012 year end &#8216;Rap&#8217; wrap-up. Love the personality that shines through - it just makes you want to explore using their product. Do you think these guys dread going to work on Monday? Click on the link below to visit the Wistia blog and play the video&#8230;.</p>

  	  <p class="date">23 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>Many times you need to communicate with all the members of a class, for example to send out an announcement. Trillo makes this VERY easy, and keeps you from having to deal with email groups (which is especially a hassle when the people enrolled in the class change.)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you needed to cancel a specific class. With Trillo you can send an email to all the students (or their Primary contacts) with one click from the &#8216;Class Details&#8217; page.</p>
<img src='/img/blog/email-class.png' />
<p>Simply view the class details and click the &#8216;Email Class&#8217; button. Type your message and hit send. An email is sent to every student (or their primary contact if they are a child.) Your email address is set as the &#8216;Reply-to&#8217; address, so your customers can reply to the message if they need to. Clients love this feature in order to reach out to all the students in a class 1 week beforehand to remind them about the class and what they should bring.</p>

<p>Need to contact more than one class? No problem! Let&#8217;s say you need to cancel ALL your classes for a specific day. Visit the Classes view and filter by the day of the week. Select all the classes and click the &#8216;Email Classes&#8217; button. The functionality is exactly the same as the image above.</p>

<p>Hope this helps make your class communications a little easier to manage!</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">16 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>Today we have launched a free email course called &#8216;Streamlining the &#8216;Tech&#8217; side of your business so you can get back to doing what you love.&#8217; Yeah - it&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful, but it describes the point of the course perfectly! Technology was supposed to make our lives easier, but too often we see clients where the technology is either getting in the way, or causing MORE work. Technology can often be an intimidating thing for some people, so we are hoping this course will take a little bit of the mystery out of things as well as give guidance on what is important vs what is not.</p>

<p>The course consists of 6 emails delivered over 3 weeks. You can unsubscribe at any time, and signing up for the course doesn&#8217;t also sign you up for more marketing from us. (We hate Spam too!) Here is what we cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your website &amp; email: Getting The Big Two Right</li>

<li>Is your website user friendly?</li>

<li>Simple steps to start automating the &#8216;not-so-much-fun&#8217; stuff</li>

<li>Have your thought about your business data lately?</li>

<li>Turn up your email marketing</li>

<li>Are you in the tech support business?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to sign up just visit <a href='/'>http://trilloclass.com</a> and scroll down the page. You&#8217;ll need to confirm your email address once you have signed up. Please let us know what you think - you can reply to any of the 6 emails from us.</p></section>

  	  <p class="date">09 Jan 2013</p>
  	</header>

  	<section class="entry"><p>A common problem for class providers who have created their own registration systems through some combination of online forms, paypal, etc. is that there is no way to automatically turn off registrations when a class is full. This creates all sorts of work for you (the provider) and also create ill-will among your customers.</p>

<p>Lets say you open registration for a one day camp to take place when the local schools are off for a teacher workshop. Smart right? Absolutely, until you email your mailing list to let them know about the class. Suddenly you have 25 registrations for a 15 student class! So now&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to figure out who is &#8216;in&#8217; and who is &#8216;out&#8217;.</li>

<li>Then contact 10 parents and tell them that even though they thought they were all set for that day, actually they aren&#8217;t. You can really screw this up by waiting for a while - then all the other camps will have filled up and your potential customers will REALLY be annoyed.</li>

<li>Did you process registration payments through Paypal? Well now you need to go into Paypal and issue 10 different refunds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suddenly that little one day class is turning into a lot of work.</p>

<p>This is where using a dedicated student/class management solution like Trillo helps. We let you set a &#8216;Max Enrollment&#8217; for every class. Once it&#8217;s full customers can no longer register for it. (The class DOES show up on the list of classes, but the checkbox to choose it is gone. We also show a message saying the class is full and they can email for a waitlist.) Now you can email your mailing list encouraging people to sign up as soon as they can because classes fill up&#8230;.but not worry about being over-subscribed!</p>

<p>One of the bigger points that gets missed here is the disappointment your customers have with you when they thought they had registered, but in fact they were too late. As a parent I can tell you that when I click &#8216;Register&#8217; I assume it is taken care of! Do you have any nightmare registration stories from being over-subscribed? Let us know in the comments!</p></section>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/start-button.jpg' />
<p>We&#8217;ve recently created an initial version of a &#8216;Getting Started&#8217; document for new clients. We walk through the basics, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up your organization</li>

<li>Setting up classes</li>

<li>Setting up your first registration form</li>

<li>Common &#8216;How Do I&#8230;&#8217; type of questions</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course we are ALWAYS available via email for any support needs, and are happy to help you set up your account. But hopefully this will give new clients a bit of a head start. The link to the page is at the bottom right of our homepage, you can also find the page here: <a href='/getting-started.html'>Getting Started With Trillo</a></p></section>

<p>This is the last post explaining the functionality behind the three buttons to the left. The final button is the &#8216;Email Class&#8217; button, and it does what you would naturally expect - it opens a window that lets you email the whole class right from within Trillo.</p>

<p>This keeps you from having to maintain separate email lists (which quickly become out of date once you add/remove someone from the class.) And it lets your instructors communicate with the class without accessing your base email account.</p></section>

  	<section class="entry"><img src='/img/blog/savetime1.png' />
<p>The first step in being prepared in the case of an emergency is to have currently emergency contact information for each child. The second step is making sure that information is easily available in every situation. Trillo helps with BOTH steps.</p>

<p>We recommend you always print a hard copy of the emergency contact information for each class. Relying on a spreadsheet is not good enough. What if the computer crashes? Your Internet access goes down? What if the instructor took the class to the park or some other off-site location?</p>

<p>Just like our attendance sheets, printing the emergency contact information is one click and you have a nicely formatted list for all the members of that class.</p></section>

<p>Trillo makes it easy to print your class attendance sheets. Simply click the &#8216;Print Attendance Sheet&#8217; button when viewing the specific class. A separate tab will open in your browser with a nicely formatted list that you can print. We include a notes field for any last minute items, and we highlight students who have not yet paid so the instructor knows to expect payment.</p></section>
