<p>Online payment is the third part of Trillo. In todays Amazon.com dominated world your customers expect and want to be able to pay for classes online. There is no question that accepting credit cards can be expensive (the fees!) and time consuming to deal with the administrative work required. Trillo has built in support for a new service that we believe is the best option BY FAR for anyone looking to accept credit cards - it&#8217;s called Stripe.</p>

<p>Stripe.com is a service that allows you to quickly start accepting credit cards. Here are the things we like most about Stripe:</p>

<p>1) NO monthly fees! Many businesses we have spoken to are paying $20-30/month just for the privilege to accept credit cards. Until recently you had no choice - you needed either a merchant account or a Paypal Business level account. Stripe charges no monthly fees beyond their transaction fee (more on that below) - no monthly fee, card storage fees, etc. You can save a significant amount of monthly costs just by moving to Stripe.</p>

<p>2) Very competitive rates. Stripe charges 2.9%+.30 cents per transaction, including Amex. If you look at the overall rate you are paying (not the teaser rate!) for ALL cards, plus your monthly fees, you&#8217;ll find Stripe to be VERY competitive. Plus the no monthly fee means you can try it out with no long term contracts or risk.</p>

<p>3) Extremely simple signup. The administrative hassles of signing up for a merchant/gateway account are legendary. Rarely do you talk to anyone who has anything good to say about the experience! Stripe removes all of that pain with a much simpler process.</p>

<p>4) A great experience for your customers. This might be the most important - a simple, clean form for your customers to pay you with. Forwarding your customers to Paypal works, but it&#8217;s not an ideal workflow. And we have clients who know of customers who refuse to pay with Paypal due to a bad experience.</p>

<p>Singing up for Stripe can be done within Trillo - that links the two applications together. (Details in a future blog post.) If you have held off from accepting credit cards in the past, it&#8217;s time to reconsider!</p></section>
