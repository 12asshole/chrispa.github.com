      <div class="row-fluid marketing">
        <div class="span6">
          <h4>Do I have to install anything?</h4>
          <p>Nope - Trillo is a web based application, so you access the software through any modern web browser. All you need is an Internet connection. Nothing to install, nothing to patch or maintain, and nothing to back-up. We take care of all of that for you.</p>

          <h4>Can we import historical information?</h4>
          <p>Yes - that is handled on a case-by-case basis and we want to make sure Trillo is right for you first.</p>

          <h4>What if I have more questions first?</h4>
          <p>We'd be happy to talk further to see if Trillo is really a good fit with your business. You can email us at hello@trilloclass.com or call 802-318-4714. If you have a website for your business let us know - that will help us review how Trillo might work for you.</p>
          
          <h4>I don't have access to a corporate credit card.  How can I demo the program?</h4>
          <p>Please just contact us at <strong>hello@trilloclass.com</strong> and let us know.  We'll get you set up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="span6">
          <h4>Can you invoice me instead? Do you offer any pre-pay discounts?</h4>
          <p>We can invoice you - though we require a 6 month commitment for any invoice. We offer a 5% discount if you pay for a years worth of service in advance.</p>
          
          <h4>What makes Trillo different from other providers like Jackrabbit?</h4>
          <p>Trillo is built with the latest web technologies to provide YOUR customers with the best registration experience. Trillo is a much simpler program - we don't believe more features means something is better. We don't sell you training because you aren't going to need it!</p>

          <h4>Do I have to use Stripe to accept credit cards?</h4>
          <p>Stripe is the only provider that we have deep integration with. But you don't have to use Stripe - you can turn off payment collection on a per-registration form basis.</p>

          <h4>Can you help me get set up?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely - once you have signed up and looked around the site please contact us to set up a time.</p>
