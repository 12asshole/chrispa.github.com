title: New Screencast - Getting Started With Trillo
tags: Video
---
We just put a new screencast on the site to help people decide if Trillo will work for their business.  If you click on the 'Video Tours' link in the navigation you'll see the embeded video.  This video is a detailed look at getting started with Trillo.  We show how easy it is to set up your organization, create a class, and then create a live registration form.  The video is 3min 30sec long, so we tried to find a good balance of showing you the power of Trillo without getting bogged down into the details.  As always, feel free to contact us if you'd like more information on how Trillo might work for your business.

Our next video will start where this one left off - we'll walk through the registration form, and then show how Trillo helps with student & class management.
