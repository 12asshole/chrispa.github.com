Trillo had a few minutes of downtime this morning....but for a very good reason.  We upgraded the database that Trillo uses to a significantly faster and more robust version.  Searches will be faster (100 - 1000x faster!), forms will load and submit faster, and the general speed of the app has improved.  

This upgrade also protects our customers data better.  Before we had daily backups - now we have what is called 'continuous protection'.  Should disaster occur we should be able to recover our database to within a seconds of it's last state.  

If you aren't using Trillo to protect your student and registration data yet, <a href="https://app.trilloclass.com/organizations/new"> get started today!</a>
