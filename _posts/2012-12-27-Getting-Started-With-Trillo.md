We've recently created an initial version of a 'Getting Started' document for new clients.  We walk through the basics, including:

- Setting up your organization
- Setting up classes
- Setting up your first registration form
- Common 'How Do I...' type of questions

Of course we are ALWAYS available via email for any support needs, and are happy to help you set up your account.  But hopefully this will give new clients a bit of a head start.   The link to the page is at the bottom right of our homepage, you can also find the page here:  <a href="/getting-started.html">Getting Started With Trillo</a>
