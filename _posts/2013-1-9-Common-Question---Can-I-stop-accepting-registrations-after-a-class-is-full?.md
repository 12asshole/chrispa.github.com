title: Common Question - Can I stop accepting registrations after a class is full?
tags:

A common problem for class providers who have created their own registration systems through some combination of online forms, paypal, etc. is that there is no way to automatically turn off registrations when a class is full.  This creates all sorts of work for you (the provider) and also create ill-will among your customers.

Lets say you open registration for a one day camp to take place when the local schools are off for a teacher workshop.  Smart right?  Absolutely, until  you email your mailing list to let them know about the class.  Suddenly you have 25 registrations for a 15 student class!  So now....

1. You have to figure out who is 'in' and who is 'out'.
2. Then contact 10 parents and tell them that even though they thought they were all set for that day, actually they aren't.  You can really screw this up by waiting for a while - then all the other camps will have filled up and your potential customers will REALLY be annoyed.
3. Did you process registration payments through Paypal?  Well now you need to go into Paypal and issue 10 different refunds.

Suddenly that little one day class is turning into a lot of work.

This is where using a dedicated student/class management solution like Trillo helps.  We let you set a 'Max Enrollment' for every class.  Once it's full customers can no longer register for it.  (The class DOES show up on the list of classes, but the checkbox to choose it is gone.  We also show a message saying the class is full and they can email for a waitlist.)   Now you can email your mailing list encouraging people to sign up as soon as they can because classes fill up....but not worry about being over-subscribed!

One of the bigger points that gets missed here is the disappointment your customers have with you when they thought they had registered, but in fact they were too late.  As a parent I can tell you that when I click 'Register' I assume it is taken care of!   Do you have any nightmare registration stories from being over-subscribed?  Let us know in the comments!
