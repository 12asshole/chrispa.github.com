title: New Report - Students With Unpaid Status

<img src="/img/blog/unpaid-status-report.png">

We just added a new page to Trillo that should be a big help to any clients who are processing registrations through Trillo but are NOT collecting credit card payments.  (Side note - why would someone do this?  Either they don't want to pay the credit card processing fees, OR they are an international business where our processor doesn't yet reach.)  It's important for these businesses to easily see who has not paid them yet!

In the Students tab there is a new button that says 'Show Unpaid'.  It will then show you a list of all enrollments that have a status of unpaid.  One thing to note - each class/enrollment is a different line.  We chose not to consolidate things as we felt it's easier to get a good sense of the overall picture of your account.

Hope this helps!
