The second area of focus for Trillo is helping a business with the ongoing management of their student contacts.  When a customer of yours fills out a Trillo powered registration form, they are set up as a contact in your account.  No more form submissions ending up in your inbox as more data entry!  For many of the businesses we have spoken to, this data entry of new registrations can be a significant waste of time.  Linking your registration forms to student management software has many other time saving benefits:

- The printing of attendance sheets and emergency contact information becomes a simple one-click process.

- No more oversold classes!  Trillo lets you limit the size of a class.  Stop spending time emailing parents to tell them their child ISN'T in your class, and then having to submit refunds through Paypal.

- Quickly see who is in what class, which classes are full, and how old everyone in a class is.  More 5 year olds registered than you are used to?  Now you know in a glance!

- Get the data out of your head and available to your staff - now instead of asking you every question they can look up the student history in Trillo.

One more huge advantage to ongoing student management - customer analytics.  Do you know your lifetime revenue per family?  How many kids take repeat classes?  How many families have multiple siblings in your program?   Trillo helps you start running your business like, well..., a business.  Your student/parent contact database is one of the most important parts of your business, and an integrated system quickly pays for itself with time savings.
