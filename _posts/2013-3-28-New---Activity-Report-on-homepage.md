We just launched a new page that will help you quickly see recent enrollments to your classes, AND speed up the site.  Two for one!  The default 'homepage' for Trillo has always been the list of your students & contacts.  There were a few problems with this....

1) Most of the time when this page loaded you weren't actually looking for a student.  It just was the default homepage and you were coming from logging in, or another action within Trillo.

2) This is our slowest, and most database intensive page to load - especially as clients get bigger and bigger (so they have more students!)  There are a number of things we can do to speed this page up all on its own (and we are working on that) but it was silly to keep loading it unless it was specifically requested.

So now the homepage shows your 15 most recent enrollments - what student enrolled in what class.  So right as you log in you are caught up to date on what has been going on. 

This is especially helpful for clients where the owner may not be involved in the day-to-day registrations, but wants to keep up to date on how things are going.  One such owner saw the new page and said:  *"That is totally perfect!!!  Love it.  Thanks so much.  Yippee!!"*  So I guess people like it!
