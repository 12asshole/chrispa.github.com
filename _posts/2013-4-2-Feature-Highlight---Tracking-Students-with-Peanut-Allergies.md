Anyone who offers classes for children knows that peanut allergies are not only extremly serious, but are becoming more and more common.  As a result, it's very important to be able to flag students who have a peanut allergy so you can be prepared, and so you can prepare the rest of the parents/students in a particular class.

This becomes more and more difficult the larger your business becomes.  More instructors, more students, etc.  It's easy for a child to slip through the cracks - but the consequences here are very real.

Trillo was built with peanut allergy flagging right from the beginning.  Parents can mark if their child has a peanut allergy right in the registration form (along with another field for Allergies where they can write a longer description.)  This flags the student in Trillo, and their profile is marked as Peanut Allergy (see the example above.)  We also highlight that fact on the Attendance Forms and the Emergency Contact Form.

If your child suffers from peanut allergies please let any class provider know about Trillo!
