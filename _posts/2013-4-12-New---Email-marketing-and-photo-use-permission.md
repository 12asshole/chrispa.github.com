Trillo now provides the ability to ask your customers three different questions when they are registering for your classes.  The most requested one is permission to add the user to an email marketing list.  Second, we let you ask permission to use photos that may be taken on your website or in marketing materials.  And finally we let you ask the user where they first heard about you!

That's the overview - keep reading if you want to know the details of how to get it working within your Trillo setup.

*HOW DO I ENABLE THE QUESTIONS?*

You enable these questions from within the registration form setup (see above.)  You cannot change the wording of the questions - you can only enable whether or not they are shown.  Because it is controlled on the registration form settings, you can have different settings for different forms.

*WHERE DO THE QUESTIONS APPEAR ON THE REGISTRATION FORMS?*

The email marketing permission question shows up on the first page of the registration - in the same section where the Primary Adult (or adult student) enters their information.  The photo permission and 'How Did You Hear About Us?' are on the final page of the checkout.

The best bet to get comfortable with these is to create a brief test registration form - enable the questions - and then fill out the form yourself to see.

Right now if someone has opted-in to email marketing, they will have that noted below their email address on their details page.  We will be providing access to the other two fields in the coming days.  Let us know what you think, and if you have any questions!
