Trillo has 3 main parts that we want to talk about.  The first is providing our customers simple online registration forms that their customers can use to register for classes.  Every time we talk to a small business who offers classes, they say the same thing:  their customers are asking for online registration.

Why is online registration important?  In today's fast paced world a business needs to allow a customer to act on their interests immediately.  This is especially important if you do any email marketing.  All that work to get a prospect interested in your classes, they are ready to sign up and then....you make them jump through a whole bunch of hoops.  Download the form, print the form, fill it out by hand, find the checkbook and write a check, find an envelope and stamp, address the envelope, and then mail it.   Trust me - if you have kids there is no way you get through these steps without being interrupted!

An online form skips all of these steps.  A prospect sees your email, clicks on a link to your website, clicks a button and fills out the form online.  Your prospect had a need, you put a solution in front of them (a class to take), and the customer was able to act on it immediately while the thought of taking action was still 'top of mind.'  The fewer steps there are in your signup process the more likely they will be completed.

What about the forms themselves?  Are there differences between forms that will cause some to work better than others?   Absolutely!  Customers are used to forms that are clear, look professional, and are easy to understand.  Online forms allow your customers to do your data entry for you, while making their own lives easier.  A true win-win!

Next up:  How customers aren't really doing your data entry for you if all that happens is that you get an email with the registration data.
