title: Student Description added to Stripe payments
tags: feature

We are now passing a little more information on to Stripe, in order to help clients reconcile payments received with the students in Trillo.  We will always pass the Student name into the charge description field, and if the student is a child we include the adult as well.  Don't forget you can also use the search function to find things quickly in Stripe, and the description field is searched.  The field is circled below.  We hope this helps!
