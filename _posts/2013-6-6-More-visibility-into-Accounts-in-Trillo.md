title: More Visibility Into Managing Accounts in Trillo
tags: feature
---

Any program that manages contact information eventually generates duplicates.  This is especially true if that data is being entered by the contacts themselves...like for online registration!  A customer may use Elizabeth the first time, and Liz the second.  Or a different email address.  Or maybe they moved, etc.  Contact managmement is kind of like weeding - stay on top of it and it's no big deal.  But ignore it and whoa! It can get out of control quickly.

Today we're introducing better tools to FIND the duplicates so they can be taken care of.  First off we've added an 'Accounts' link to the top menu bar.

You can search Accounts just like Students to quickly narrow down the list.  You can add a new Account, and the list shows the Account name, the # of people associated with that Account, and those names.  Each column can be sorted by simply clicking on the column header.  This lets you quickly see where there might be issues...for example by sorting by # of People you may find some families with duplicates.

Inside the Account you can add children or adults to the account, edit the account name to make it clearer, delete the account (if there are no members), or access any of the detailed views of any of the customers.

This is just version one, but it's been very useful as we try to locate issues between accounts.  Let us know what we can improve!
