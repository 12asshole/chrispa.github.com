The first step in being prepared in the case of an emergency is to have currently emergency contact information for each child. The second step is making sure that information is easily available in every situation. Trillo helps with BOTH steps.

We recommend you always print a hard copy of the emergency contact information for each class. Relying on a spreadsheet is not good enough. What if the computer crashes? Your Internet access goes down? What if the instructor took the class to the park or some other off-site location?

Just like our attendance sheets, printing the emergency contact information is one click and you have a nicely formatted list for all the members of that class.
