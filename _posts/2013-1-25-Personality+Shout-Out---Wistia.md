title: Personality Shout Out - Wistia

As a web software provider, I get exposed to a lot of other web services in my day-to-day life.  Some of them are services we use here at Trillo, and others are just ones I explore to see what I can learn.  One common theme among some of what I consider the 'Best' services are that they let their personality shine through.  It's easy to be 'goofy' - what's hard is to be genuine.  (It's shouldn't be hard, but for some reason it is.)

So I'm occasionally going to highlight a few here on our blog because I think they are great examples of how every small business can show their customers that there are real people behind the business.  Let me know what you think!

Wistia is a video hosting provider.  They drink their own kool-aid, and produce fantastic videos to announce just about everything they do.  Below is their 2012 year end 'Rap' wrap-up.  Love the personality that shines through - it just makes you want to explore using their product.  Do you think these guys dread going to work on Monday?
