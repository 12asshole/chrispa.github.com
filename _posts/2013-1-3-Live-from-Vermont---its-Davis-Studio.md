We're proud to announce that our initial Trillo client went live with Trillo today (and they've already processed registrations!)  <a href="http://davisstudiovt.com" target="new">Davis Studio in Vermont</a> was started almost 13 years ago by Teresa Davis and has since grown to become Burlington's premier provider of classes to foster creativity.  Both of my children have taken multiple classes at the studio, so it has been great to work with them to help create Trillo.

If you live anywhere near Burlington VT I recommend you check them out!  <a href="http://davisstudiovt.com" target="new">http://davisstudiovt.com/</a>

Congratulations!

Chris Patton - Founder / Trillo
