'Explainer' videos have been very popular lately, but we didn't think we had the expertise or the budget to put one together.  Then we found <a href="http://www.powtoon.com/" target="new">Powtoon</a>, a super easy way to create explainer videos.  A couple of weeks later and, voila!, we've now got one.  It's lots of fun putting one of these together, and the constraints around what graphics you can show really make you think through your message.  We hope this helps explain Trillo to people who just didn't quite get it before.

Looking for a little more detail?  Don't worry - soon we will have a longer screencast of Trillo in action, and we are going to add shorter 'How do I...' clips to help new users get up and running.  Now that we have the video bug it's kind of hard to stop!
