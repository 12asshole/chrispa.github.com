title: Introducing our new email course - Streamlining your tech so you can get back to doing what you love

Today we have launched a free email course called 'Streamlining the 'Tech' side of your business so you can get back to doing what you love.'  Yeah - it's a bit of a mouthful, but it describes the point of the course perfectly!  Technology was supposed to make our lives easier, but too often we see clients where the technology is either getting in the way, or causing MORE work.  Technology can often be an intimidating thing for some people, so we are hoping this course will take a little bit of the mystery out of things as well as give guidance on what is important vs what is not.

The course consists of 6 emails delivered over 3 weeks.  You can unsubscribe at any time, and signing up for the course doesn't also sign you up for more marketing from us.  (We hate Spam too!)  Here is what we cover:

1. Your website & email: Getting The Big Two Right
2. Is your website user friendly?
3. Simple steps to start automating the 'not-so-much-fun' stuff
4. Have your thought about your business data lately?
5. Turn up your email marketing
6. Are you in the tech support business?

If you'd like to sign up just visit <a href="/">http://trilloclass.com</a> and scroll down the page.  You'll need to confirm your email address once you have signed up.  Please let us know what you think - you can reply to any of the 6 emails from us.
