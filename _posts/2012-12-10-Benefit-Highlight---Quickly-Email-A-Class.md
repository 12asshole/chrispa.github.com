This is the last post explaining the functionality behind the three buttons to the left.  The final button is the 'Email Class' button, and it does what you would naturally expect - it opens a window that lets you email the whole class right from within Trillo.

This keeps you from having to maintain separate email lists (which quickly become out of date once you add/remove someone from the class.)  And it lets your instructors communicate with the class without accessing your base email account.
