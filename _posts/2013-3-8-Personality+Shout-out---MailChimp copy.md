As a web services company, we get exposed to a lot of other web services in my day-to-day life.  One common theme among some of what I consider the 'Best' services are that they let their personality shine through.  It's easy to be 'goofy' - what's hard is to be genuine.

So we're occasionally going to highlight a few here on our blog because we think they are great examples of how every small business can show their customers that there are real people behind the business.  

# MailChimp

MailChimp helps millions of people design, send, and track their email newsletters.  We use them for ours, and highly recommend them.  MailChimp's personality shines throughout their site.  In fact it shines so brightly some customers must have complained!  There is a 'Party Pooper' mode in the account settings for people who are, well,  party poopers.

But even though the 'MailChimp Personality' is everywhere, it doesn't detract from the experience.  They use that personality to guide you the somewhat complicated experience of creating and sending email newsletters.
