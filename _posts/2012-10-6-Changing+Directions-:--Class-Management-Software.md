It’s not uncommon for new businesses to end up serving a completely different customer than they originally intended to.    The photo site Flickr started out as a feature of an online game.  Groupon started as an online activist platform!   Trillo started as a student management tool for independent music teachers.   But in talking with that market an even bigger problem (and opportunity!) emerged – helping businesses who offer classes for children a simple tool to enable online registration, online payment, and ongoing student management.

The most common solution to the problem is to either:

1. Have customers print out, fill out, and mail in a registration form with a check

2. Use a combination of online forms, Paypal, and spreadsheets

Neither of these are great solutions for the business, or for their clients.  Systems end up being a mish-mash of different services where customer data is repeated (and often out of date) and data entry is endless.  Current solutions are expensive and/or out of date.

Providers who offer classes for children have even more issues.  They need to collect emergency contact information, make sure waivers are signed, and track things like peanut allergies.   Parent interactions are brief – so it pays to get things right the first time.

We have some fantastic beta clients (more on them later), and a very clear problem to solve.  Trillo will be live right around Thanksgiving.  If you currently offer classes and are struggling with online registration we’d love to talk to you about how Trillo can help.
