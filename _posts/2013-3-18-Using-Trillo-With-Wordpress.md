We have had some questions about using Trillo with Wordpress, and want to make sure it is clear to business owners and web developers who are evaluating Trillo that **Trillo works great with Wordpress.**  In fact, Trillo works great with whichever web platform you choose to use to market you business.  How?  Because Trillo doesn't replace your website.

Trillo hosts your registration pages.  So all you need to do to integrate Trillo with your Wordpress (or any) site is to point your 'Register For Classes' button to your Trillo hosted web form.  This provides a clear separation between your 'Marketing' site, and your online registration forms.  So no messing about with Plugins to try and get thing working!

We ARE able to customize the header image on our forms to match your website, so most of your customers will never know they are on a different website.  If you have questions about how to integrate Trillo with your site please don't hesitate to contact us!
