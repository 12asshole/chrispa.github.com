One of the items on our feature list is the ability to ask for a donation to a scholarship fund when a client is checking out.  While that is a few months away, there is a quick 'n easy way that you can have up and running right now.  Here's how it works:

1)  Create a new session and call it 'Scholarships'

2)  Create a class that is called something like 'Scholarship Fund Donation - $10'
- Have the class dates be from Jan 1 - Dec 31st
- Set the enrollment at a large #...say 100
- Put the class in the Scholarships session

3) Now for every Registration form you create, have the 'Scholarships' session classes show on it as well as the other classes.  Now there is a 'Class' that people can sign up for in addition to the other classes that will add a $10 charge (or whatever you set it to) to their total.

One of the advantages here is that when a client donates to the fund they become part of the Sholarship class.  So now you have a record of all the people who have donated.  That makes it easy to send them a nice letter at the end of the year detailing how their generosity helped!
