Trillo makes it easy to print your class attendance sheets. Simply click the 'Print Attendance Sheet' button when viewing the specific class. A separate tab will open in your browser with a nicely formatted list that you can print. We include a notes field for any last minute items, and we highlight students who have not yet paid so the instructor knows to expect payment.
