title: Class Communication the easy way with Trillo
tags: 
---
Many times you need to communicate with all the members of a class, for example to send out an announcement.  Trillo makes this VERY easy, and keeps you from having to deal with email groups (which is especially a hassle when the people enrolled in the class change.)

Let's say you needed to cancel a specific class.   With Trillo you can send an email to all the students (or their Primary contacts) with one click from the 'Class Details' page.

Simply view the class details and click the 'Email Class' button.  Type your message and hit send.  An email is sent to every student (or their primary contact if they are a child.)  Your email address is set as the 'Reply-to' address, so your customers can reply to the message if they need to.  Clients love this feature in order to reach out to all the students in a class 1 week beforehand to remind them about the class and what they should bring.

Need to contact more than one class?  No problem!  Let's say you need to cancel ALL your classes for a specific day.  Visit the Classes view and filter by the day of the week.  Select all the classes and click the 'Email Classes' button.  The functionality is exactly the same as the image above.

Hope this helps make your class communications a little easier to manage!
