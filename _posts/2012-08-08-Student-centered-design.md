title: Student Centered Design
---
When we started designing Trillo, one of the first things we needed to decide on was what the software would be ‘centered’ on.  That is, what is the most core and basic part of the software that connects everything else?  What is the thing that, if it was missing, would remove the whole point of using the software?

The answer was pretty simple – **it’s the student.**

We started calling the idea *‘student centered design’*, and we’ve used that phrase to guide us when making decisions about what features to include, and more importantly, how to include them without making the software bloated, difficult to navigate, hard to update, and no fun to use.  Your music teaching practice revolves around your students, so we think it makes sense for your software to do the same. There was a great blog post last Friday from Fred Wilson, who is a prominent Venture Capitalist in NYC, and who has a wonderful blog.  He talked about what the ‘atomic unit’ of your web service is….and that if you don’t know (or have gotten away from it) you have a problem.  It’s a great way to think about software design and coming up with a list of key principles to guide you.
