Clients who have Stripe connected to Trillo now receive a daily email every morning with a summary of the registrations from yesterday, along with a summary of all Stripe charges.  It's a great way to quickly see 'what happened', as well as see if there are any issues you need to investigate.

Always nice to wake up to a 'here's the cash you made yesterday' email!

10/22/13 UPDATE - just received an email from a client with the subject line 'Daily Summaries Rock'   Great to hear they are helping!
