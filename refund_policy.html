        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Trillo has a 30 day free trial policy for new customers.  A valid credit card is required to begin a trial.  The card information is collected to reduce fraud and provide uninterrupted service should you decide to continue using Trillo.</p>
        <p>The free trial may be canceled at any time by emailing support@trilloclass.com.  Please note your Organization name when contacting us.  We will attempt to contact you a few days before your free trial ends via email, but our failure to do so does not extend your trial period.</p>
        <p>Trillo is a month-to-month service and you may cancel at any time by contacting us at support@trilloclass.com.   <strong>Pro rated refunds will not be provided and you will be responsible for all charges made to that point.</strong>  When service is canceled you will still have access to your Trillo account until that 'month' (based on your signup date) is over.  Once service has ended to your account your Organization and Account data will be deleted. </p>
        <p>Please contact us with any questions or concerns regarding this policy.</p>
